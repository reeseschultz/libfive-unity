# libfive-unity

A quick CSharp/Unity wrapper for the amazing [libfive](https://github.com/libfive/libfive).

Supports operator overloading, tons of convenience functions, context-based automatic disposal of unmanaged resources, and a strong editor interface.

## Warnings

- Only basic mesh rendering is implemented for the output; use the unwrapped, untested functions in `libfivesharp.libFiveInternal` at your peril!
- Many of the convenience functions found in `libfive-Studio` have not been reimplemented here.
- Much of the functionality is untested!
- Save often! The plugin has been known to crash Unity from time to time!

## Binaries

Includes Windows (`.dll`) and Linux (`.so`) binaries.
